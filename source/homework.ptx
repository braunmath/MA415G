        <title>P1</title>
        <p>
            Define an <em><m>m</m>-ary string</em> to be an ordered list of length <m>n</m> where each entry is an element of <m>[m]:=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}</m>.
            We denote by <m>[m]^n</m> the set of <m>m</m>-ary strings of length <m>n</m>.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Systematically list the elements of <m>[3]^3</m> and <em>explain using written sentences</em> what your system is for listing all of these elements.

                        Give a <em>recursive</em> proof, following the structure of the recursive proof of <xref ref="thm-binarystringenumeration"/>, that 
                        <me>

        <p>
            How many binary strings of length <m>n</m> are there with exactly two ones and <m>(n-2)</m> zeros?
            Express your answer as either a function of <m>n</m> or as a recursive expression.

        <title>Essay 1</title>
        <p> Write an essay in which you reflect on a meaningful mathematical experience from your past.
This might be a positive experience or it might be a negative experience, but it should be something that was influential in your mathematical life, and <em>you should explicitly discuss how mathematical ideas/concepts were involved in this experience</em>.
As a prompt for your writing, consider some of the following questions (you do not need to respond to all of these, rather use them to help you get your writing started).
<ul>
<li><p>Was this influential because of the mathematical content you learned, or because of a personal experience that took place in a mathematical context, or because it changed how you thought about yourself with regard to mathematics, or something else entirely?</p></li>
<li><p> Did this experience cause you to take on future challenges, or to avoid certain challenges?</p></li>
<li><p> What was different about this experience from other similar experiences that makes this one stand out in your memory?</p></li>
</ul>
This assignment should be 500 words, which is equivalent to two pages, 12 point Times New Roman, double spaced.
Your grade is based on completion only (in other words, if you complete the assignment and it meets the length requirement and responds appropriately to the prompt, then you get full credit).

        <title>P3</title>
        <p>
            In this problem, we explore another property of binomial coefficients.
            Equations such as this are known as <em>combinatorial identities</em>, because they are equalities of expressions involving combinatorial values.
            Using the technique of disjoint union decompositions, prove that for any <m>0\leq k \leq n</m>, we have
                <me>
                    \binom{k}{k}+\binom{k+1}{k}+\binom{k+2}{k}+\cdots +\binom{n-1}{k}+\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n+1}{k+1} \, .
                </me>  
        </p>
    </problem>
    <problem>
        <title>P4</title>
        <p>
            Give a combinatorial proof showing that
            <me>
                \sum_{k=0}^nk\binom{n}{k}=n2^{n-1} \, .
            </me>

        <title>P5</title>
        <p>
            <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singmaster%27s_conjecture">Singmaster's conjecture</url> is an open problem in mathematics, meaning that it is a problem that has not been solved by anyone.
            Note that the number <m>1</m> appears infinitely many times in the triangle of binomial coefficients.
            The open problem is as follows: Is there a fixed integer <m>N</m> such that every positive integer other than <m>1</m> shows up at most <m>N</m> times in the triangle of binomial coefficients?
        </p>
        <p>
            Make as much progress as you can on this open problem; I don't expect you to find a solution, but you should spend 2-3 hours thinking about this!
            Your goal is to do something more than check examples; the examples should lead you to make some interesting observations about the problem, to understand it a bit better.
            Why do you think it might be true?  
            Why might it be false?
            Are there any properties of binomial coefficients that support your comments?
            Are there any positive integers for which this is obviously true?
            You can do this using only pencil and paper, or using mostly computational experiments, or you can use a mix of these.
            However, you need to provide a narrative in sentences/paragraphs explaining your thinking and the results of your investigations.
            (Seriously, write down everything you're thinking and every idea you try, even if it doesn't go anywhere.)

                         A subset <m>A\subseteq [n]</m> is called <em>large</em> if we have that <m>k\geq |A|</m> for every <m>k\in A</m>.
                         So, for example, <m>\{3,5,7\}</m> is large while <m>\{2,4,6\}</m> is not large.
                         We define that the emptyset <m>\emptyset</m> is large.
                         Let <m>L(n)</m> be the number of large subsets of <m>[n]</m> (including the emptyset).
                         Find a relationship between <m>L(n)</m> and the Fibonacci numbers and prove that your answer is correct.

            Read the following blog post by Keith Weber, a professor of math education at Rutgers University who studies how undergraduate students understand proofs in mathematics: <url href="https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2015/02/10/mathematics-professors-and-mathematics-majors-expectations-of-lectures-in-advanced-mathematics/" />
            After you read this article, complete the following essay.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This will be an essay of length at least 500 words, which is equivalent to at least 2 typed pages with 1 inch margins, 12 point Times New Roman font, double spaced. (You can write a longer essay if needed.)

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your essay should respond to the following three questions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                    The article describes four expectations that professors have for students, but which are usually mis-communicated. <em>For each of these four expectations</em>, do you respond more like the students in their surveys, or more like the professors? Why?
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    The discussion at the end of the article has some recommendations for faculty in their courses. Which of these recommendations do you think you would find most helpful for your learning, and why?
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                    What is one thing you might change about your approach to your math courses after reading this article? Why is this the thing you would choose to change?
                                </p>

        <title>P12</title>
        <p>
            Recall that <m>I_{n,k}</m> is the number of permutations in <m>\ss_n</m> with <m>k</m> inversions, and <m>A_{n,k}</m> is the number of permutations in <m>\ss_n</m> with <m>k</m> descents. 
            Give a combinatorial proof that
            <me>
                I_{n,k}=I_{n,(n(n-1)/2)-k}
            </me>
            and 
            <me>
                A_{n,k}=A_{n,n-1-k} \, .

                    <p>
                        In the first part of this problem, you will prove by induction that <me>\sum_{j=1}^n j=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\, .</me>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    First, verify the <em>base case</em> for the induction argument, i.e., check that this is true for <m>n=1</m>.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    Second, assume that this is true for all values less than <m>n</m>.
                                    In particular, this means that we assume we have already verified that <me>\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}j=\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\, .</me>
                                    To prove that the <em>induction step</em> holds, use this to prove that the equation holds for <m>n</m> as follows: write <me>
                                        \sum_{j=1}^n j = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} j\right) + n 
                                    </me>
                                    and then substitute the formula for the <m>n-1</m> case and simplify with algebra.                             
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Explain in your own words why this shows that the formula is true for any positive integer <m>n</m>.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Prove by induction that <me>\sum_{j=1}^nj^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\, .</me>

            Comment for those who are interested: These two formulas are ones that students learn (and typically forget) in Calculus I. 
            However, these are special cases of a beautiful formula called Faulhaber's formula which is a formula for the sum of the <m>p</m>-th powers of the first <m>n</m> positive integers:

            A graph <m>G</m> is <em>bipartite</em> if the vertex set of <m>G</m> can be partitioned as <m>V=A\uplus B</m> in such a way that every edge in <m>G</m> has one endpoint in <m>A</m> and one in <m>B</m>.
            Prove that <m>G</m> is bipartite if and only if every cycle in <m>G</m> has an even number of edges.

        <p>
            A <em>graceful labeling</em> of a tree <m>T</m> on <m>n</m> vertices is a mapping <me>f:V(T)\rightarrow \{1,\ldots,n\}</me> so that for each edge <m>\{x,y\}</m>, the value of <me>|f(x)-f(y)|</me> is distinct from the value on any other edge.
            The <em>path graph of length <m>n</m></em>, denoted <m>P_n</m>, is the graph with vertex set <m>\{1,2,\ldots,n,n+1\}</m> and edges <m>\{i,i+1\}</m> for every <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>.
            Show that every <m>P_n</m> has a graceful labeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: A well-known and extremely challenging unsolved conjecture is that all trees admit graceful labelings. This is known for some trees but not all trees.

        <p>
            Watch the following YouTube video from <em>Numberphile</em> (13 minutes, published 29 Jan 2024): <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczN0BCx0xs" />

After you watch this video, complete the following essay.
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            This will be an essay of length 500 words, which is equivalent to 2 typed pages with 1 inch margins, 12 point Times New Roman font, double spaced. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Write a critical review of this Numberphile video.
      Imagine that you are writing your review for a journal for undergraduates in mathematics and the sciences, so your primary audience is undergraduate math/cs/engineering/etc majors and minors.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Like any critic, you will respond positively to some things and negatively to others.  
        Unlike many critics, you need to justify your opinions and provide detailed explanations for your claims.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            You should consider the following questions:
        </p>
    </li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Does the video effectively communicate the mathematics it discusses? Why or why not? Justify your claims with specific details about the video.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We have discussed multiple approaches/themes to enumeration in this course, for example, recursions, bijections, systematic listing, etc. 
                Which of these approaches/themes to enumeration are used in this video? Be detailed, give specific examples from the video!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the mathematics clearly explained? If yes, what did they do especially well? If no, what made it unclear? Again, justify your claims with specific examples from the video.
            </p>

    </ol>
</ul>

Be detailed with your reasoning! It is acceptable to have a mix of responses to this issue, but you need to clearly explain your thoughts.

Section 3 of the syllabus begins with a quote from Timothy Gowers.
Given what you have seen so far in combinatorics, do you agree with his assertion about the way that the "important idea of combinatorics" appear? Why or why not?                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
So far we have investigated techniques for solving enumeration, classification, and expectation problems. Which of these have you enjoyed the most? Which have you enjoyed the least? Why? Give specific examples from the homework and/or notes to illustrate your opinions.                                </p>

Page 2 of the syllabus lists four mathematical practices that students will develop in MA 415G, in addition to the eight questions of combinatorics. Which of these practices do you feel you have improved on the most so far this semester? Which do you are most in need of further development?                                </p>

                                    The article presents six ethical lenses that can be used when considering ethical decision making: the rights lens, justice lens, utilitarian lens, common good lens, virtue lens, and care ethics lens.
                                    Which <em>two of these lenses</em> resonate most strongly with your personal thoughts about ethics? Why?
                                    Which of these lenses do you feel least connected to at this moment? Why?

                                    The article presents a sequence of ten questions to consider in the process of ethical decision making.
                                    Suppose you are working as a member of a team, for example in a professional or personal context, and your team is going through the ethical implications of different options for resolving an issue.
                                    Which <em>two of these questions</em> do you think would be most challenging to engage in conversation with the other people on your team?
                                    Why?
                                </p>
