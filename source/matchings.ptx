    <title>Maximum Matching in Graphs</title>

    <p>
        One of the fundamental ideas of applied math is to find ways to effectively pair or match objects or entities.
        For example, matching problems arise when we want to pair workers with jobs, students with courses, and other situations where paired assignments are required.
        The mathematical idea that captures this is the concept of a matching in a graph.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Given a finite graph <m>G</m>, a <em>matching</em> is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex.
                A <em>maximum matching</em> is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges. 
                The size of a maximum matching is called the <em>matching number</em> of the graph.
            </p>
        </statement>

    <example>
        <p>
            Let <m>K_n</m> be the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices. The maximum matching in <m>K_n</m> has size <m>\lfloor n/2 \rfloor</m>, since we can pair up the vertices in pairs, and if there is an odd vertex left over, it cannot be matched.
        </p>
    </example>

    <exercise>
        <p>
            Consider the Petersen graph shown below. 
            Consider the matching given by the edges <me>\{01,34,57,68\}</me>.
            Is this a maximum matching? If not, find a larger matching.
            How do you know that a matching is maximum?

    <p>
        Given a graph <m>G</m>, we will set our task to find a maximum matching in <m>G</m>.
        This will be the metric we will use to evaluate the "best" matchings -- they will be the matchings that have the largest possible number of edges.
        Given a matching <m>M</m> in <m>G</m>, we want to try to systematically find a way to find a larger matching, or to determine that no larger matching exists.
