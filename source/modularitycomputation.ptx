    <title>Algorithms to Maximize Modularity</title>

    <p>
        We have now developed a well-defined problem to solve in order to optimally split a network into one or two communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Problem:</em> Given a network <m>G=(V,E)</m> where <m>V=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> and <m>|E|=m</m>, find the vertex partition <m>V=V_1\uplus V_2</m> (where it is possible for one of these sets to be empty) that maximizes the modularity function 
        <me>
            Q = \frac{1}{4m}\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq |V|}B_{i,j}s_is_j 
        </me>
        over the set <m>s\in \{-1,1\}^n</m>.        
    </p>
