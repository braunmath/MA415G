        Let's begin with a review of what SNA is. 
        The instructor will review the first paragraph or two of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis" /> as an overview.

    <p>
        Next: the instructor will review some of the practical applications of SNA listed in <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis#Practical_applications" />.

        <p>
            Consider the example of Longitudinal SNA in Schools. 
            What type of ethical questions might one need to consider for such studies? 
            Which of the six ethical lenses might be helpful for addressing such questions?            
        </p>

            Consider the example of Security Applications. 
            What type of ethical questions might one need to consider for such studies? 
            Which of the six ethical lenses might be helpful for addressing such questions?            
        </p>
    </exercise>

    <p>
        We will next discuss some aspects of the paper by Tubaro et. al.
        The instructor will next read the third paragraph of the section titled "The difficult relationship between SNA and research ethics" and the first paragraph of the section titled "Digitization and its challenges to SNA research".
    </p>

    <exercise>
        <p>
            Informed by the six ethical lenses, what types of ethical questions do you might be asked about confidentiality prior to conducting a social network study?
            Are there ways in which the six ethical lenses conflict with each other in this context? Do any of the lenses complement or reinforce each other in this context?
